Easily embed your Woobox promotions in WordPress using a simple shortcode.

== Description ==

Embedding your Woobox promotions on your WordPress site has never been easier! This plugin allows quick and easy installation of your promotion with the use of shortcode **\[woobox\]** for embedding on WordPress.

Woobox helps you easily create powerful contests, sweepstakes, coupons, quizzes and more to grow your audience and amplify your marketing.

You could embed promotions on WordPress before, but the process was complicated and didn't work for all types of users on WordPress. We wanted to simplify the process, so we created the **Woobox** plugin and made it available for all our faithful WordPress users. You create a promotion on Woobox, grab the WordPress shortcode and with the plugin installed on your WordPress site, just paste it into any post or page on WordPress and that's it.

== Installation ==

1. Search for "**Woobox**" from the admin area of your WordPress site in "Plugins > Add New".
2. Remember to activate the plugin through the "Plugins" menu in WordPress.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is Woobox? =
Woobox is an online platform that helps you easily create and manage powerful contests, sweepstakes, coupons, quizzes and more to grow your audience and amplify your marketing.  [Learn more about Woobox.](http://www.woobox.com)

= Why is this plugin useful? =
Shortcodes are cleaner and simpler! Only Editors and Admins can copy and paste the JavaScript embed code to embed a Woobox promotion onto a WordPress page, authors cannot.

With embed codes you need to make sure to be in the "Text" tab of the writing area. If a user is in the "Visual" (default) tab, the embed code will not work. Shortcodes will always work in either text editor.

= I already have a promotion using the old embed code! Will it still work on WordPress? =
Yes! Your promotions will continue to function with no problem. Honestly, if you want to keep using the old method for embedding, that's fine. We just created the shortcode, like it was said before, because it's cleaner and simpler.

= Is it difficult to install and setup? =
Nope, it's so easy! Check out the [Installation section](/plugins/woobox/installation) to see just how easy it is.

= What parameters work with the shortcode, and what do they do? =
* **offer**: The id of your promotion. This is found at the end of your Woobox URL (Woobox.com/abc123)  Valid offer id would be promotion id "abc123".
* **params**: Parameters to pass to your promotion. This is advanced functionality, and only recommended if there are specific keys/values you need to pass to your offer's custom JavaScript.
* **style**: Optional parameter that changes the way your offer is displayed on the page. Default value is "embed", but can also be set to "popup" if you want to go that route.
* **trigger\*\***: Possible values: "enter" show when page loads; "exit" show when user is detected leaving page; "timer:8" show after a certain number of seconds (8 in this example);
* **expire\*\***: Determines how often (in days) the popup is displayed to any given user. Possible values: "-1" only show once ever; "0" always show; "1" once per day; "7" once per week;

*\*\*Only applies to "popup" style offers.*

Now if that was over your head, no need to worry about it. Just install the plugin, copy the embed shortcode from Woobox after creating the promotion and paste it into WordPress and your promotion will look great!
